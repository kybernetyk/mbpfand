A simple fan speed control demon for Linux + Apple Mac Book Pro (5,5).

My Macbook Pro 5,5 runs pretty hot till the fan on linux kicks in. 
This is an attempt to create a demon that will fix this behavior.

The fan speed formula is for now a simple logarithmic function and
seems a little too sensitive in the early mid ranges.

I'm planning to replace all that ugly math with a highly over-
engineered goal oriented system - but for now the math stuff
works pretty well ;)

Compatibility can only be ensured with MBP 5,5 13" models yet.
I heard rumors of the bigger MBPs (15/17") having more than one
fan built in. But as I don't have access to those models I can't
verify that. You are however welocome to send me an email,
open an issue in the issue tracker with your model's information.
(Or fork the code and build and hack it yourself).


How To Build
============

1) The demon is written in Go and requires Go 1.
